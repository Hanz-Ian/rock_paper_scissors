# A game of Rock, Paper, Scissors in Python

## Description
This is just a very small project/task that I chose to do as a way of learning Python,
so I hope you don't mind seeing this but for anyone that's also in the learning stage
of Python, this could be helpful for you. I included comments mostly in every single line.
That way you can understand how it is done. All credits go to Bro Code, he provides
great coding courses!
