# A game of Rock, Paper, Scissors in Python

## Description
This is just a very small project/task that I chose to do as a way of learning Python,
so I hope you don't mind seeing this but for anyone that's also in the learning stage
of Python, this could be helpful for you. I included comments mostly in every single line (Note
that it is not a good practice to put a lot of comments, this is just a learning demonstration
for me so I can look back at this and learn as much information as I can get from this and
hopefully it's the same for the beginners here.). That way you can understand how it is done.
